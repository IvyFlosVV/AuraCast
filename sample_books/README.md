# Sample books for testing AuraCast

Put your example eBooks here (e.g. **The Little Prince.epub**) so you can easily find them when testing the app.

## How to use

1. Copy **The Little Prince.epub** (or any PDF/EPUB) into this folder.
2. Open the app in your browser (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5001).
3. Click **"Choose PDF or EPUB"** and select the file from this folder.
4. Click **"Parse book"** → then pick an episode and **"Generate Episode"**.

Short books like The Little Prince use fewer API calls and less quota than long novels, so they’re ideal for free-tier testing.
